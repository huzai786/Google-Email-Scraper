mailtrapsupertesting+premiumacc@gmail.comWith Gmail, you can create unlimited email addresses from within your account. You don’t 
need to go through any configuration and won’t get any addresses like fnfh3443hj3hgt@gmail.com (unless you request that!). With Gmail,
 you can simply add a ‘+’ to the username and follow it with any word or combination of alphanumeri
c characters you can think of. So, for example, for the email address mailtrapsupertesting@gmail.com, we could create:
mailtrapsupertesting+saasupgrade@gmail.com
